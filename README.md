# ðŸŸ¢ KickChat Client

## **What is Kick Chat Client ?**

The KickChat Client is a small, TypeScript-based wrapper for [kick.com](https://kick.com)'s chat system. It uses WebSocket & unofficial API endpoints. and can automatically create new WS connections when the current ones reach their maximum capacity.

This client is designed to simplify the process of building chat bots and other chat-related applications for [kick.com](https://kick.com).

If you're looking to start building a chat bot or other chat-based applications, the KickChat Client is a great place to start. Its lightweight and has a basic handler logic makes it a good choice as a starter.

# Changelog

### v0.3.0

- Added support for replying to messages.
- Improved project structure, cleaner code.

### v0.2.0

# R&D Notes

- Sending messages, replies, and reactions are now possible via unofficial v2 API endpoints & require x-csrf-token & Cookies & other headers.

- There is currently no official API documentations from the Kick team, and attempting to access the public endpoint will mostly result in cloudflare or authentication related errors.

# Future Todos

- Add role-based access control to the chat features (e.g. moderation actions, pinning messages, etc.)

- Implement replies & reactions.
